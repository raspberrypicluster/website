    <h1>MTRX: Prosumer Raspberry Pi clusters</h1>
    <h2>Plug and play. Optimized. Supported. Simple.</h2>

    <p>
      Raspberry pi clusters are great for home labs but it’s hard to know if
      your research to find the components for a build is accurate, finding
      suppliers for in-stock well-supported parts is time consuming, and the end
      results can be slow, clunky, or just not work.
    </p>

    <p>
      We did the work of researching, crafting, curating, assembling,
      benchmarking and testing a solid RPi cluster for you. MTRX is easy. Just
      power it up, connect to your WiFi and you’re started.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Zero risk</b> <br />
      We guarantee that your MTRX cluster works. If you’re not satisfied, for
      any reason, at any point within a year of purchase, we will replace your
      cluster or give you a full refund.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Open source heritage </b><br />
      Our products stand on the shoulders of incredible open source software and
      hardware. We endeavor to clearly identify every open source project in our
      ecosystem, and to contribute as much as we can to the community via open
      sourced content, code and designs.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b> Design parameters </b><br />
      MTRX clusters are designed, built, and supported with the following tenets
      in mind:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Minimize incidental complexity. We want to make it as simple as possible
        for our users to productively use their cluster with as little
        unnecessary effort as possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        Maximize compatibility and performance. MTRX clusters are made up of the
        best, most compatible components we can find so you can enjoy years of
        performance and support with minimal fuss.
      </li>
      <li>
        Support high end use cases. Raspberry Pi is a lightweight but powerful
        computing platform, and our bill or materials complements and enhances
        this power and flexibility.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Built for professionals and enthusiasts, MTRX clusters power home labs
      capable of true distributed systems experiments, Kubernetes cluster
      testing environments, and high availability low-cost clustered
      applications.

    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>Can I get the cheaper 2Gb model?</dt>
      <dd>
        No, sorry. We designed our system around eking out as much from these
        boards as possible. The 4 and 8Gb versions were clear victors in our
        benchmarking, and for our target use cases we deemed 2Gb insufficient.
      </dd>
      <dt>Do you have an 8node version?</dt>
      <dd>
        We are designing it right now. Please get in touch with us, we would
        love to hear about your use case
